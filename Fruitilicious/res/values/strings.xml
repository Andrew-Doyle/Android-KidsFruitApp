    <string name="appdescription">"This application launches with a splash screen which is set to show for a few seconds before proceeding to the main activity (fruitview).The user can navigate via the ActionBar. The Actionbarsherlock library was utilised to enable this feature for Android 2.x onwards (The Actionbarsherlock project is included in the submission since it must be referenced by the application project).\n\nImage Span and Spannable String were used to style the fruit names on each fruit`s page. 9 Patch images were used to ensure images scaled without distortion. \n\nPlease note that this application is for educational purposes only - and there isn`t really a TV to be won."	</string>
